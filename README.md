## 2: GPU Acceleration of k-Nearest Neighbors using RAPIDS

### Description

This project demonstrates the power of GPU acceleration in machine learning by comparing the performance of the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm on CPU and GPU platforms. The CPU version of kNN is implemented using scikit-learn on the MNIST dataset, while the GPU version utilizes RAPIDS cuML. The significant speedup achieved by the GPU version highlights the advantage of utilizing GPU resources for machine learning tasks.
